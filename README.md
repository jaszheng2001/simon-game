1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

I reference w3school and the MDN when I was trying to recall a javascript method or a specific css syntax.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

I didn't face too many challenges in this submission, as I did have some prior
knowledge of web development. I guess the hardest part of the challenge is the 
game logic. In the first few test run of the app, I had to debug the program to
find out when each variable should be reset. For example, one time I forgot to 
reset the guess counter variable to 0 at the end of each turn. To overcome and debug
some of the troubles, I used the debugger as well as print statements. I did implement
some more basic features such as difficulty level and randomized patterns. That part of 
the project, I had almost no trouble. In addition to the gaming logic, I did add some more 
markups to the frontend. I centered everything, and turned the button area into a grid layout,
so when you view the website on different screen sizes, it will keep the same 2 row and 2 column orientation. 
I did have to use a little MDN and stack overflow to try to resolve an alignment issue, which I found out,
was due to a misspelling. W3school was another resource I used to help me, since the example they provide 
gives a good glimpse of what the code does.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

The one thing that I've never understood about web development so far is how do we make it
appear in google searches. I understand the concept of SEO and that's what google uses to 
index your page on their search engine. However, I've created 2 business landing page before, 
and I can never get it ranked on the google search algorithm. I understand in this day in age,
having a business landing page can drive your business forward, and just technology in general.
That's why I want to learn more about web development and get a glimpse of the different technology 
being used at a big company.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would definitely make the game 
more customizable and improve code readability. Improving code readability will make
it easier to push any updates to the project and improve the collaboration experience 
with other developers. So far in addition to the requirements, I've added some additional features.
I've added the difficulty button which changes the way the game is played. As the 
difficulty increases, the speed of the clue also increases and the length of the pattern
also increases. The project would be better if I added an option for the user to allow for
multiple guesses. I did notice a lot of repeating code in the project as well, that I could 
combine into one function and reuse it. Additionally, it improves 
customizability of the settings of the game, since I would only need to change codes in one place.
